Device simulator application that allows uses to emulate a device writing to an Exosite dataport, whether as a one-off or a simulated pattern (script). 

This was originally written as a Heroku app and later reworked to exist on an early version of Exosite's "ADT" hosting platform using convox and docker. The master branch contains the heroku app, while the convox app is located in branch convox-grunt.

Please note I moved this project from JQuery to Angular midstream, so the two coexist in a suboptimal way that I would have reworked if it had greater priority/time allocation. 

Similarly, important UI elements (e.g. loading feedback) are also absent owing to the unfinished nature of this app.
