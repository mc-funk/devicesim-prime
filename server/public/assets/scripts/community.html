<h1>Coding Community</h1>
<p>Technically the first lines of code I ever wrote were in QBasic, writing some awful text-based RPGs as a kid. But as an adult, the tech community drew me in months before I was on my way to being a software developer.

<p>PyLadies Twin Cities brings women, trans, and non-binary folk together to deepen both our understanding of Python and our strength as a supportive community. As of 2015 I joined the organizing team for PyLadies, and host a bi-weekly "brunch and learn" event in which we gather to watch tutorial videos and discuss fundamental concepts in Python. It's been very successful in providing "back to basics" learnings for expernienced and inexperienced Pythonistas alike.</p>
